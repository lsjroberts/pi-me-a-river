Merely looking at stock-market performance and a vague figure encompassing ?unemployment?, isn?t adequate for evaluating the ?state of a nation.?If you break down some of the main positive economic performance differences between the Clinton and Bush [jr.] administrations, you will find that Clinton?s outpaced Bush?s in; National Debt reduction by about 4.5%, increased jobs by 2.5%, and increased jobs that actually provided good wages by 4.7%.The per capita GDP increased about 0.8% more than under Bush, and the average household income went up nearly 2.8% more.People living above the poverty line increased 6.5%, and home ownership 1.5%.Only in productivity has Bush?s administration surpassed Clinton?s by a margin of 1.9%.In fact, most people polled just after Clinton?s term, believed that he had also outdone Bush [Snr.] in the areas that mattered most.Most of these areas affect the population far more directly than what the stock market closes at. Don?t forget how speculation, cornering or insider trading skews that up.Simply stating the numbers above also has little practical value in assessing a country?s performance. To gain more insight, one would have to compare the national debt, and trade deficit reduction figures to the GDP, number of jobs [both full and part-time], and the myriad of other factors that are involved, for both administrations, to even begin to have a clear picture.I personally have a very strong distaste for politics in general, and I am not an ?actual? economist? But I don?t allow that to cloud my awareness of how ALL governments will use the populaces? ignorance of any given subject as a manipulative or control mechanism?Then there?s your statement about terrorism. In my humble experience, many things affect how much ?terrorism? is wreaked upon a country, and when it will flare-up.First however, you really have to ?define? exactly what terrorism encompasses.Most regular folk LIKE to define it as ANY action taken against them [whether justifiable or not] that negatively affects THEM. This is nothing more than the proverbial ?spin? I reference before.The world is a complicated place to survive in, and there are three sides to every coin.A country?s foreign policy greatly influences how it is perceived and received, just like an individual person?s personality influences how that person is treated, it is just on a much larger scale. As memory serves me, there have been notable terrorist ?attacks? against the U.S. during most governmental terms [both Dem. And Rep.]I don?t think that many terrorists particularly care who the hell has been in a government for the last few years? They have been conditioned over a lifetime to hate another country, it?s people or policies. The type of hatred and desperation required to commit an act of terrorism against another nation, takes a considerable amount of time and effort to foster.Does a school shooting constitute terrorism?

The reality is no terrorist attack of that magnitude is planned and implemented in 8 months. Sending millions to die so he could make millions from oil.. tell me what koolaid your drinkin cause I want some.. that is ridiculous not to mention completely unsupported by facts.  What his family owns oil stocks.. hmm so do I.  As for Troubles facts, thank you and you make some excellent points, however I must.. (MUST) point out that Clinton numbers are based against the first bush's  recession and most  serious  economist credit bush one with turning around the economy before Clinton coming into office  the fact that Clinton left bush 2 with the beginnings of a recession.. (NasDaq losing half it's value in a year??.. remember that  people..).. makes the fact that Bush Two's economic record all the more impressive.Then Consider a. 9/11b. The tech Crash / Clinton's recession.c. Enron, Worldcom, ect..Bushes numbers are being compared against outrageous growth (the internet boom)  and they still are far from bad.  ( That was sort of my point that things really aren't really that bad I realize Kieth's bleeding heart over there is hurtin and I understand he is a sensitive guy. Still feel war needs to be approached from a somewhat logical and detached point of view.  Do I like all of Bushes economic ideas, war or general policies no but I do not think on any level he is doing things that he feels are not in the United States best interest. I will also now spew some of deeper stat's since trouble started it.For the third consecutive year, the U.S. economy is poised to grow faster than most other industrialized economies. France, Germany, and Japan, for instance, are not expected to grow even half as fast as the United States.Since the Bush administration began, non-farm productivity has increased at a 4.1 percent annual rate ? the fastest pace for the start of any presidency since Harry S. Truman occupied the White House.The U.S. remains the world's largest exporter. In fact, during the first three years of the Bush administration, the U.S. exported more in real terms than it did during the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations combined.More single-family homes were sold in 2003 than in any other year on record. And the homeownership rate is at a record-high of 68.5 percent ? a full percentage point higher than during the fourth quarter of 2000  NOTE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE HARDER IT IS. I do not think generally overall any president has power to influence the U.S economy but I do think it is important to state facts rather then just insanity.  I really do think all Presidents do their best for the American people, and I also think the shakeup in congress is good for the country.  I do support the war and what it could plausibly accomplish. (A U.S ally in the middle east like S.Korea is in Asia and Germany is in Europe   we killed great swaths of those people also)P.S. Trouble if u upgrade to FireFox 2.0 it will probably help your penis.  P.S. I can see Keith approaches politics like Fanasty Football..he really doesn't study the facts or statistics.   Seriously tho, if you can't support your point of view with a fact or some non-emotional then your just spewing non-sense. Shouting the loudest doesn't change history or facts.","_id":"MP7eIltODwE8cAuZ"}

Terrorist attacks even happen within their own countries! The sunni and shiite muslims are in a constant conflict with sunni parents and their children being shot coming out of a convinient store in june, and an activist of the Sunni Tehrik was gunned down in the limits of garden police station on Sunday.These people, these muslims, they are an unstable breed. They cannot be controlled at all. They have grown up in a society in which right and wrong are reversed and their leaders brainwash them into service for deplorable causes after promising them  paradise . They cannot be dealt OR reasoned with. Their hatred towards us is unfounded, illogical, and it will remain as such. I laughed at your statement about prosecuting them. Number one, they are terrorists to the United States of America, as such, they are in no way entitled to the rights to remain silent, the rights to attorney, and the right to fair trial. They are enemies of the country and deserve a swift execution.An interrogator in Gitmo DID try to get info out of a prisoner peacefully, by way of seduction. The female interrogator wanted to “break him,” she removed her uniform top to expose a tight-fitting T-shirt and began taunting the detainee, touching her breasts, rubbing them against the prisoner’s back.The detainee looked up and spat in her face.Now, I do admit that the way she attempted to retrieve the information was disgusting and horrid, but you can see how they react! They are indignant to any form of reason.(Oh and by opposite reaction, it does not infer that the action taken should be the opposite of the action recieved, it means it should be given by the pposite side  but that's beside the point.)You keep refering to my emotional connection to 9/11. I'll ask you to keep in mind, I don't just detest the reasoning with islamic terrorists, I hate reasoning with ANY terrorist. Anyone who aims to kill as many people as possible in one event deserves to have their device misfire and kill themself instead, not just muslim extremeists.The republicans voted against the 9/11 bill because they did not approve the procedure of the funding, the anti-rape ammendment was actually shot down by a leading DEMOCRAT, the health care bill would be universal and a burden to taxpayers, the stimulus bill was a phenominal waste of money, the immigration bills proposed by the democrats would provide amnesty and voting rights for illegals, and democrats need to slow down their rapid-pass policy system in order to converse with republicans about the aspects of a bill before slamming it down congress's throat! And the republicans use the fillibusters, because it is the only way that they can prevent democratic policies from being implemented.So, you are saying that if an inexperienced business is not prepared for the tax cuts expiring, then too bad? Thats it? Just let them struggle? Wait, I have a better idea, why not save everybody the trouble and just KEEP THEM? And significant unemployment?? The current unemployment rate is 9.2%, while the unemployment rate from 2000 to 2008 did not exceed 6.6%. And THEEEEEEN when a certain person was elected for a certain office in 2008, the unemployment rate went from 6.6% in november of 08, and progressively climbed to 9% in January of 2009. Nice job democrats.","_id":"NopJjl2RtwArAdLs"}

Merely looking at stock-market performance and a vague figure encompassing ?unemployment?, isn?t adequate for evaluating the ?state of a nation.?If you break down some of the main positive economic performance differences between the Clinton and Bush [jr.] administrations, you will find that Clinton?s outpaced Bush?s in; National Debt reduction by about 4.5%, increased jobs by 2.5%, and increased jobs that actually provided good wages by 4.7%.The per capita GDP increased about 0.8% more than under Bush, and the average household income went up nearly 2.8% more.People living above the poverty line increased 6.5%, and home ownership 1.5%.Only in productivity has Bush?s administration surpassed Clinton?s by a margin of 1.9%.In fact, most people polled just after Clinton?s term, believed that he had also outdone Bush [Snr.] in the areas that mattered most.Most of these areas affect the population far more directly than what the stock market closes at. Don?t forget how speculation, cornering or insider trading skews that up.Simply stating the numbers above also has little practical value in assessing a country?s performance. To gain more insight, one would have to compare the national debt, and trade deficit reduction figures to the GDP, number of jobs [both full and part-time], and the myriad of other factors that are involved, for both administrations, to even begin to have a clear picture.I personally have a very strong distaste for politics in general, and I am not an ?actual? economist? But I don?t allow that to cloud my awareness of how ALL governments will use the populaces? ignorance of any given subject as a manipulative or control mechanism?Then there?s your statement about terrorism. In my humble experience, many things affect how much ?terrorism? is wreaked upon a country, and when it will flare-up.First however, you really have to ?define? exactly what terrorism encompasses.Most regular folk LIKE to define it as ANY action taken against them [whether justifiable or not] that negatively affects THEM. This is nothing more than the proverbial ?spin? I reference before.The world is a complicated place to survive in, and there are three sides to every coin.A country?s foreign policy greatly influences how it is perceived and received, just like an individual person?s personality influences how that person is treated, it is just on a much larger scale. As memory serves me, there have been notable terrorist ?attacks? against the U.S. during most governmental terms [both Dem. And Rep.]I don?t think that many terrorists particularly care who the hell has been in a government for the last few years? They have been conditioned over a lifetime to hate another country, it?s people or policies. The type of hatred and desperation required to commit an act of terrorism against another nation, takes a considerable amount of time and effort to foster.Does a school shooting constitute terrorism? Is it different if a country?s own citizens resort to terrorist tactics against their then government? [i.e. McVeigh]. Were terrorist acts committed during your own civil war? Was your war of independence different from the Contra?s, Afgani?s, Croat?s plights?It?s unfair to even bring terrorism into the equation? Most of the groups perpetratin? the hatin?, have been doing so for a hundred years or more? And won?t stop anytime soon?Don?t think I am talking out-of-my-ass? I have narrowly missed being blown-the-hell-up by the IRA several times, most notably when they hit the Sussex arms pub in Covent garden, a friend and I, had left the bar and headed towards Chinatown looking for food just moments before a bomb went off and killed a man and injured a few others.Dammit, now I really feel like a pundit?

Sending millions to die so he could make millions from oil.. tell me what koolaid your drinkin cause I want some.. that is ridiculous not to mention completely unsupported by facts.  What his family owns oil stocks.. hmm so do I.  As for Troubles facts, thank you and you make some excellent points, however I must.. (MUST) point out that Clinton numbers are based against the first bush's  recession and most  serious  economist credit bush one with turning around the economy before Clinton coming into office  the fact that Clinton left bush 2 with the beginnings of a recession.. (NasDaq losing half it's value in a year??.. remember that  people..).. makes the fact that Bush Two's economic record all the more impressive.Then Consider a. 9/11b. The tech Crash / Clinton's recession.c. Enron, Worldcom, ect..Bushes numbers are being compared against outrageous growth (the internet boom)  and they still are far from bad.  ( That was sort of my point that things really aren't really that bad I realize Kieth's bleeding heart over there is hurtin and I understand he is a sensitive guy. Still feel war needs to be approached from a somewhat logical and detached point of view.  Do I like all of Bushes economic ideas, war or general policies no but I do not think on any level he is doing things that he feels are not in the United States best interest. I will also now spew some of deeper stat's since trouble started it.For the third consecutive year, the U.S. economy is poised to grow faster than most other industrialized economies. France, Germany, and Japan, for instance, are not expected to grow even half as fast as the United States.Since the Bush administration began, non-farm productivity has increased at a 4.1 percent annual rate ? the fastest pace for the start of any presidency since Harry S. Truman occupied the White House.The U.S. remains the world's largest exporter. In fact, during the first three years of the Bush administration, the U.S. exported more in real terms than it did during the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations combined.More single-family homes were sold in 2003 than in any other year on record. And the homeownership rate is at a record-high of 68.5 percent ? a full percentage point higher than during the fourth quarter of 2000  NOTE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE HARDER IT IS. I do not think generally overall any president has power to influence the U.S economy but I do think it is important to state facts rather then just insanity.  I really do think all Presidents do their best for the American people, and I also think the shakeup in congress is good for the country.  I do support the war and what it could plausibly accomplish. (A U.S ally in the middle east like S.Korea is in Asia and Germany is in Europe   we killed great swaths of those people also)P.S. Trouble if u upgrade to FireFox 2.0 it will probably help your penis.  P.S. I can see Keith approaches politics like Fanasty Football..he really doesn't study the facts or statistics.   Seriously tho, if you can't support your point of view with a fact or some non-emotional then your just spewing non-sense. Shouting the loudest doesn't change history or facts.","_id":"r3bcZPa5TTp8n2sL"}

Terrorist attacks even happen within their own countries! The sunni and shiite muslims are in a constant conflict with sunni parents and their children being shot coming out of a convinient store in june, and an activist of the Sunni Tehrik was gunned down in the limits of garden police station on Sunday.These people, these muslims, they are an unstable breed. They cannot be controlled at all. They have grown up in a society in which right and wrong are reversed and their leaders brainwash them into service for deplorable causes after promising them  paradise . They cannot be dealt OR reasoned with. Their hatred towards us is unfounded, illogical, and it will remain as such. I laughed at your statement about prosecuting them. Number one, they are terrorists to the United States of America, as such, they are in no way entitled to the rights to remain silent, the rights to attorney, and the right to fair trial. They are enemies of the country and deserve a swift execution.An interrogator in Gitmo DID try to get info out of a prisoner peacefully, by way of seduction. The female interrogator wanted to “break him,” she removed her uniform top to expose a tight-fitting T-shirt and began taunting the detainee, touching her breasts, rubbing them against the prisoner’s back.The detainee looked up and spat in her face.Now, I do admit that the way she attempted to retrieve the information was disgusting and horrid, but you can see how they react! They are indignant to any form of reason.(Oh and by opposite reaction, it does not infer that the action taken should be the opposite of the action recieved, it means it should be given by the pposite side  but that's beside the point.)You keep refering to my emotional connection to 9/11. I'll ask you to keep in mind, I don't just detest the reasoning with islamic terrorists, I hate reasoning with ANY terrorist. Anyone who aims to kill as many people as possible in one event deserves to have their device misfire and kill themself instead, not just muslim extremeists.The republicans voted against the 9/11 bill because they did not approve the procedure of the funding, the anti-rape ammendment was actually shot down by a leading DEMOCRAT, the health care bill would be universal and a burden to taxpayers, the stimulus bill was a phenominal waste of money, the immigration bills proposed by the democrats would provide amnesty and voting rights for illegals, and democrats need to slow down their rapid-pass policy system in order to converse with republicans about the aspects of a bill before slamming it down congress's throat! And the republicans use the fillibusters, because it is the only way that they can prevent democratic policies from being implemented.So, you are saying that if an inexperienced business is not prepared for the tax cuts expiring, then too bad? Thats it? Just let them struggle? Wait, I have a better idea, why not save everybody the trouble and just KEEP THEM? And significant unemployment?? The current unemployment rate is 9.2%, while the unemployment rate from 2000 to 2008 did not exceed 6.6%. And THEEEEEEN when a certain person was elected for a certain office in 2008, the unemployment rate went from 6.6% in november of 08, and progressively climbed to 9% in January of 2009.

You contradict yourself a lot, don't you?Calling all muslims evil may not help the cause, but its better than letting them silently overrun our country. Abdul Faruk wrote a book in arabic talking about the stealth jihad in the United States. They are talking about silently taking over America just like they did to England.Giving tax cuts to the rich do not help them get richer, they PREVENT them from having an unreliable government from taking the money with they rightfully earned. If someone is successful enough to get rich, why do the liberals always want to punish them for it? and polls are meaningless because people are stupid. ??What the heck is wrong with you?! Youre calling people stupid for taking a survery and expressing their opinions?! Polls show what the majority of America want so youre calling the majority of America stupid  you really do have an open mind, you know that?The reason that the Republicans are not trying to pass anything is because they CAN'T. They say no because that's all they can do, they can't pass anything because it'll be voted against by dems, they can't stop anything because it'll be voted FOR by dems. I dont know if you've noticed or not, but the majority of the house is DEMOCRAT, and it's been that way for a long time, not just since 2008. The house was mainly democratic during the bush era, but nobody acknowledges that when they bash bush, do they? That's why the country is going down.Personally I support the Republicans because they are doing everything in their power to stop the dems in their tracks. Democrats have been persuing their agendas since before bush. If Kerry had been elected (god forbid) then this same situation would be happening then.Im pretty sure I have been answering all of you're questions as best I can.

People didn't think America could be attacked in such a way as 9/11 either. People didn't think the Titanic could sink, nor that the hindenburg would explode.If rich people keep money with out giving it to the government it does not add to their wealth it stops it from being cut. They don't get any more they they normally would without the government taking part of it. I believe that if someone earns 1 billion dollars, then they deserve it. And they deserve to pass it down through their family and do whatever they want with it.We support the rich because they represent what we aspire to be. They represent success. They represent the American dream, to make it in their lives. Without rich people, where are the role models to show the result of hard work? Of rising from nothing to excellence? And I agree that America needs taxes to function. What I don't agree with is the constant raising of them.I have plenty of friends who care about politics, in fact, over half of them are liberal. And then I know a lot of people who couldn't care less about them. So tell me, if you didn't care for politics, why would you answer a survey instead of simply ignoring it? Precisely, you wouldn't.The democrats have no need to work with the republicans. Why would they? They outnumber them (for now) and can pass anything and everything that they want. And since obama is just a puppet for congress, then they can't rely on him vetoing anything either.Yes, the republicans would be up in arms, but then, the democrats don't have a reason to care, because the republicans cannot do a thing to stop them now can they?I do want to improve America, but I want the right group of people to be working on it, not the democrats. The democrats are not trying to move America forward, they are trying to make it like the rest of the world. American should NOT be like the rest of the world.You know what? Fine!

Here's why: The dems were is such a hurry to get this bill passed, that they slammed it down the throat of congress. The reason they were in such a hurry was that they knew if the bill got out, people would actually read it and may have had second thoughts. If they were not afraid of people changing their minds, then why didnt they give them more time to read it?Youre telling me you think that the health care bill and all of obama's policies are not even  remotely liberal .Then you have absolutely not idea what liberalism is.You also say that it is hard to get anything passed in congress, that may be true, but not when the majority of congress is leaning left. Every democrat voted for the health care bill, the republicans were outnumbered. So yeah, liberals are in control of congress an if you deny it, then youre just as ignorant as those who dont know who joe biden is.Every tea partier is uniformed and angry because we have lived in a liberal country long enough. You say they are not qualified for office, did you know that George Bush graduated from Yale AND Harvard law school? I would say he was VERY qualified.All liberals are are spoiled people who will stop at absolutely NOTHING to stay in office and keep their power. And then they claim that everything they say is correct, attempting to pass the delusion that all of America is on their side.

I'll follow up on that.  I've seen it attributed to many other people.In any case, I didn't discover this on my own.  But I did reconstruct how it works in a number of ways.  (1) assuming that it works, you can find the curve and the distribution of grid points on the curve that are required to make it work.  (2) you can verify that it works, algebraically.  (3) you can verify that it works, geometrically.  (4) you can look for variations of the scheme, or different applications of the scheme.Any or all of these give interesting results in their own right.","_id":"SsSaJUNXLk853839"}

Science fiction, with its extrapolations of current trends into the future, tends to pick up on things that are less long-term trends than they are short-term fads, since it can be very hard to tell the two apart with only a couple years' data. Out of every group of the 10 Next Big Things, 9 of them usually turn out to be short-lived flashes in the pan. Unfortunately, those duds tend to find there way into science-fiction movies.What they miss is the large degree of cultural continuity over long periods- e.g., if you dress today like Hugh Beaumont's Ward Cleaver did on Leave it to Beaver, nobody will think there is anything odd about your appearance, though you might get a compliment or two for going to the trouble of putting on a jacket and tie. Heck, a man in his '20s today could wear his great-grandfather's suit from 1925, and while he might come off a little formal or slightly eccentric, people would still generally agree that he was very well-dressed, because there just hasn't been much fundamental change to the formal-level sartorial standard for men in the past 90 years. The tuxedo has been standard since at least the 1890s, and is still popular at the 2013 Oscars. Women's fashions have changed a lot more, of course, because women are more fashion-conscious, and also because feminism launched a war against anything too redolent of traditional femininity.Incidentally, I watched \"Star Wars\" many times as a child, but it was only as an adult that I realized how much it positively reeked of the Disco Epoch in which it was born. The shaggy haircuts, the open collars, the Billy Dee Williams... not to mention the aura of decaying rustiness that George Lucas insisted on having his prop crews create. In envisioning this \"used future\", were they echoing Carter-era malaise, when you couldn't buy gas for your shoddily-made car? In contrast, the Prequels are bright and clean... and nothing but completely fake computer trickery, much like the easy prosperity of the Clinton-Bush II years. Anyway, I probably shouldn't speculate more than that, since I have a rule that states that \"Nobody over the age of 12 is allowed to take Star Wars seriously\".","_id":"6DhWBrpdwoAXsaRP"}

Forest fires depend on certain weather conditions (e.g. high winds, lack of rainfall, ect) and it might be difficult to plan exactly when and where the exact conditions will exist. I guess you could just toss a random road flare into a random pile of brush each day, but every time you do that you increase the chance that someone sees you and you wind up sitting in prison wondering where it all went wrong. In a similar vein you run the risk of having the fire successfully extinguished before it gets very far, which will also spark an arson investigation which could put L.E. on your case and impede future (more effective) terrorist attacks. And even if the fire gets going, it's difficult to prove that YOU (your organization or whatever) actually did it. Now that I think about it, the only way it really works well is if you start the fire, leave plenty of evidence, and make sure you get caught (they're willing to die for the cause anyway).   My .02?

Science fiction, with its extrapolations of current trends into the future, tends to pick up on things that are less long-term trends than they are short-term fads, since it can be very hard to tell the two apart with only a couple years' data. Out of every group of the 10 Next Big Things, 9 of them usually turn out to be short-lived flashes in the pan. Unfortunately, those duds tend to find there way into science-fiction movies.What they miss is the large degree of cultural continuity over long periods- e.g., if you dress today like Hugh Beaumont's Ward Cleaver did on Leave it to Beaver, nobody will think there is anything odd about your appearance, though you might get a compliment or two for going to the trouble of putting on a jacket and tie. Heck, a man in his '20s today could wear his great-grandfather's suit from 1925, and while he might come off a little formal or slightly eccentric, people would still generally agree that he was very well-dressed, because there just hasn't been much fundamental change to the formal-level sartorial standard for men in the past 90 years. The tuxedo has been standard since at least the 1890s, and is still popular at the 2013 Oscars. Women's fashions have changed a lot more, of course, because women are more fashion-conscious, and also because feminism launched a war against anything too redolent of traditional femininity.Incidentally, I watched \"Star Wars\" many times as a child, but it was only as an adult that I realized how much it positively reeked of the Disco Epoch in which it was born. The shaggy haircuts, the open collars, the Billy Dee Williams... not to mention the aura of decaying rustiness that George Lucas insisted on having his prop crews create. In envisioning this \"used future\", were they echoing Carter-era malaise, when you couldn't buy gas for your shoddily-made car? In contrast, the Prequels are bright and clean... and nothing but completely fake computer trickery, much like the easy prosperity of the Clinton-Bush II years. Anyway, I probably shouldn't speculate more than that, since I have a rule that states that \"Nobody over the age of 12 is allowed to take Star Wars seriously\".","_id":"AKrxwgEwd7KlhgOE"}

The problem is conceptual, in that \"income\" is ultimately impossible to define. I seem to recall reading that there is no legal definition of the term. That was a couple of decades ago, but the problem is essentially this. If I do a job for you or give you something and you pay me money, that money is income, which is reasonably straightforwards until one starts to work of the costs of doing the work - tools, raw materials, payments to other people, etc.But if we barter the goods and services, are both of us or neither of us receiving \"income\"? And what if we are bartering the goods and services through a LETS scheme? Is it then income? Are LETS schemes a tax avoidance mechanism? Or possibly even a tax evasion device?Ultimately, all earned income comes through barter in which money is a token of exchange. But of course if the government is taking a cut at each and every exchange, the temptation is go do it off the books.Then there are those 400 people who are reported to have \"earned\" more than a310 million. What did they actually do to get this money? It is not, by any chance, economic rent of land, because if it is, \"earned\" is precisely the wrong word to use. http://lpzgdu.com [url=http://dydpxnep.com]dydpxnep[/url] [link=http://dtsavbddswa.com]dtsavbddswa[/link]","_id":"OVQTWwlITMxR6eYL"}

The problem is conceptual, in that \"income\" is ultimately impossible to define. I seem to recall reading that there is no legal definition of the term. That was a couple of decades ago, but the problem is essentially this. If I do a job for you or give you something and you pay me money, that money is income, which is reasonably straightforwards until one starts to work of the costs of doing the work - tools, raw materials, payments to other people, etc.But if we barter the goods and services, are both of us or neither of us receiving \"income\"? And what if we are bartering the goods and services through a LETS scheme? Is it then income? Are LETS schemes a tax avoidance mechanism? Or possibly even a tax evasion device?Ultimately, all earned income comes through barter in which money is a token of exchange. But of course if the government is taking a cut at each and every exchange, the temptation is go do it off the books.Then there are those 400 people who are reported to have \"earned\" more than a310 million. What did they actually do to get this money? It is not, by any chance, economic rent of land, because if it is, \"earned\" is precisely the wrong word to use. http://fcsgxe.com [url=http://nnvzgugoy.com]nnvzgugoy[/url] [link=http://zydpmy.com]zydpmy[/link]","_id":"RP3fHEJzdZ1of5GR"}

We have lots of algorithms that are superior to eyeballing data on a map but that isn't what *presenting* the data in map form is about   you can do Moran's I without ever seeing the data mapped (you do lose a lot of information that way but you can still determine if there is a statistically significant spatial pattern). You get a different appreciate for the data and analysis when you can see it visually. The question about mapping data really should be if the question is spatial. If you aren't answering a question that is spatial, presenting the data, in map form adds nothing to the analysis so don't do it, which is a kind of question that should be applied to every sort of data visualization (does this help illustrate the answer the question posed?).Back to the route-finding expamle, I depend on Google Maps to find the best route for me but I always look at the map of the route not just the list of turns because visually seeing the relation between where I am and where I am going gives me a better understanding of the directions that just reading a list of left and right turns (in fact, since I have trouble connecting the words left and right with the actual relationship of left and right I am likely to get lost depending on the text description rather than the visual depiction). http://makspyk.com [url=http://qaejwyeuo.com]qaejwyeuo[/url] [link=http://ddfhjbw.com]ddfhjbw[/link]","_id":"IoNg7PZ39HdB0vYK"}

We have lots of algorithms that are superior to eyeballing data on a map but that isn't what *presenting* the data in map form is about   you can do Moran's I without ever seeing the data mapped (you do lose a lot of information that way but you can still determine if there is a statistically significant spatial pattern). You get a different appreciate for the data and analysis when you can see it visually. The question about mapping data really should be if the question is spatial. If you aren't answering a question that is spatial, presenting the data, in map form adds nothing to the analysis so don't do it, which is a kind of question that should be applied to every sort of data visualization (does this help illustrate the answer the question posed?).Back to the route-finding emxpale, I depend on Google Maps to find the best route for me but I always look at the map of the route not just the list of turns because visually seeing the relation between where I am and where I am going gives me a better understanding of the directions that just reading a list of left and right turns (in fact, since I have trouble connecting the words left and right with the actual relationship of left and right I am likely to get lost depending on the text description rather than the visual depiction). http://uklwfulewq.com [url=http://zsksvecbt.com]zsksvecbt[/url] [link=http://tcufpws.com]tcufpws[/link]","_id":"U0CqzjF89bUYbNOb"}

Looked at my blackberry address book. found some people's phone numbers missing.6. did a battery pull. the phone numbers that were missing after sync re appeared. Also, the speed dial setting for those phone numbers were correct.7.Did another google sync, cal and contacts. If failed, waited and re tried. quickly noticed that at least one contact on the BB were ok, didnt check them all. sync failed a few more times. Take note, not the cal sync, just at the time of contact sync did it fail. It also ran for while before it pooped out. When it finally did go, it took a reaaaaalllly long time.8.checked google people with just a home addy now had the home addy duplicated.9.checked blackberry, it duplicated addresses.. one person had just a home addy, they now have the home addy in the work addy too. the phone numbers were gone again too.10. did a battery pull11.duplicate addy on BB disapeared and phone numbers were back.12. cleaned up contacts on google side with duplicate addresses.13. synced again for fun. I like to press my luck14. it still took a while15. BRBeven after cleaning up contacts on the google side, it still had issues. for contacts with a phone number and a home addy, it kept adding the home addy to the google contacts over and over. so if it synced 3 times, it showed the home addy 4 times in the google contacts. I dont know why. every time i deleted those addies from google and synced again, it deleted the phone numbers from the berry and I would do a battery pull and they would show up again. very strange.

It won't do you any excellent to just saw off length without making compensations for the other things you'll change.  That will only lead to frustration for your daughter and a possible disinterest for the game.I would go for a custom fitted set of either clone or component brands.  Don't sweat the cost, though: it won't be $ 600- it'll also posibly be cheaper than buying a used set and having it retro-fitted.  I wouldn't sweat the  clone  brand, either  from what I've been able to find out so far, the only place there's a corporal resemblance is the soleplate (I'm still working on why that is); they're comparable to  name  brands as far as playability is concerned.  Component brands are just that: golf gear in its unassembled form.  There are some that are on the expensive side, like KZG or Bang, and there's some that are very affordable, like GolfWork's Distance Master line or Hireko Golf's Acer line (a personal favorite of mine).Hopefully, there's a local clubfitter near you.  A Y! search or a  clubfitter locator  search at a website like Tom Wishon Golf Technologies would help out more, since most don't advertise in the Yellow Pages. http://azajwhqcx.com [url=http://khphlfqy.com]khphlfqy[/url] [link=http://dokdhcao.com]dokdhcao[/link]","_id":"MJr437YwIVOircaU"}

They all have pretty heavy customizations and pretty complex home pages that are PAGES and not POSTS, with sidebars and widget areas etc. The plugins mangle the complexity and turn it into a mess.I've actually hired someone to do my mobile site, and as soon as I can get to reviewing and editing the content it'll go live. It will, after launch, sit in a subdomain m.creativeimplementations.com.Besides mangling the display, other reasons to have a different version delivered to mobile devices:* chances are you really don't need to deliver you entire site to a phone. Most of the time, folks are looking for your contact information and maybe, MAYBE your latest blog post.  They don't need years worth of archived articles or complext contact forms that may not work on their device.* when you use a plugin (or even a stylesheet + browser recognition code) to deliver the same website to a mobile device, I don't know if Google recognizes that as a true mobile website.

Sending email to people who are not expecting it can have a very big impact in a negative way.  Getting permission, setting clear expectations for your subscribers, delivering on your subscribers' expectations, and being respectful of their time is going to have a big impact in a positive way.  The decision of whether to have a positive or a negative impact is up to each person.  The regulations are only going to become stronger   it's smart to follow the best practices and hold your business to a higher standard now, rather than try to play catch-up later.

I look for that aspect every time I evaluate a new business tool   I don't want to waste time learning how to use a new tool AND create a new process if there is already one I can customize to my own purpose.Great post   and a great reminder to take another look at how I am<a href=\"http://caklxq.com\"> gtietng</a> in my own way.","_id":"P5Lw0yuH111mB2NO"}

Looked at my blackberry address book. found some people's phone numbers missing.6. did a battery pull. the phone numbers that were missing after sync re appeared. Also, the speed dial setting for those phone numbers were correct.7.Did another google sync, cal and contacts. If failed, waited and re tried. quickly noticed that at least one contact on the BB were ok, didnt check them all. sync failed a few more times.

BRBeven after cleaning up contacts on the google side, it still had issues. for contacts with a phone number and a home addy, it kept adding the home addy to the google contacts over and over. so if it synced 3 times, it showed the home addy 4 times in the google contacts. I dont know why. every time i deleted those addies from google and synced again, it deleted the phone numbers from the berry and I would do a battery pull and they would show up again. very strange.

They all have pretty heavy customizations and pretty complex home pages that are PAGES and not POSTS, with sidebars and widget areas etc. The plugins mangle the complexity and turn it into a mess.I've actually hired someone to do my mobile site, and as soon as I can get to reviewing and editing the content it'll go live. It will, after launch, sit in a subdomain m.creativeimplementations.com.Besides mangling the display, other reasons to have a different version delivered to mobile devices:* chances are you really don't need to deliver you entire site to a phone. Most of the time, folks are looking for your contact information and maybe, MAYBE your latest blog post.  They don't need years worth of archived articles or complext contact forms that may not work on their device.* when you use a plugin (or even a stylesheet + browser recognition code) to deliver the same website to a mobile device, I don't know if Google recognizes that as a true mobile website. It's something to watch for, because Google is starting to value sites more that have mobile versions.Make sense?","_id":"pXHfe35Vlbz1L5Nz"}

Bach for Rating: I found this little gem in my larbiry.  I agree with other reviewers that this is an easy read; after I got past the first page, I just inhaled it.  As a father of two children who aren't too different in age from the Higham children, it was easy for me to feel like I was traveling in their group.  Why did I enjoy it so much?  Because: 1.  It is laugh-out-loud funny, but it isn't a funny book, if that makes any sense.2.  It made me lie awake at night thinking about what I want to teach my own children about the world, and how best to accomplish that. What I really liked about this book is that it wasn't about somebody's mid-life crisis that they inflicted on their kids.  The idea of traveling as a family was in the works for over a decade, before the author and his wife even had kids.  Why?  To paraphrase the author, he had learned how travel can shape one's thinking and wanted to give that experience to his children.  In that sense, it isn't about some rich family's adventure, but about an average family's desire to discover the world.As you might imagine, a lot (good and bad) can happen over the course of traveling for a year.  There is too much to list, and I don't want to spoil any of it if you haven't read the book yet. BUT I admire their tenacity to keep going; some of the misadventures would have sent lesser people (like me) home.  As their year unfolds you see the family not only grow closer together but also see them grow as a family.  For example, the larger lessons one might learn at Auschwitz are apparently lost on the two young children because of large crowds and unbearable heat.  But by the time those same two children arrive at the Killing Fields outside of Phnom Penh, the heat is no longer a factor and it is clear that the ugliness of war makes a lasting impression, even on the eight-year-old, who sums up their time in Cambodia by saying,  Some things you remember even though you wish you didn't have to.  The end result is a great story.  Perhaps not in the Harry Potter sense of the word  great,  but it has its own greatness that is palpable because it is a story of real events.  I think anyone who wants to gain an appreciation for other cultures should read this book. So, if I picked up a copy in my larbiry, why am I writing a review on Amazon?  Because like another reviewer, I decided that I was making this my gift of choice this Holiday season.  And the first person I'm giving it to is myself. http://sfamlsbe.com [url=http://jnqpufc.com]jnqpufc[/url] [link=http://uybmmfpkj.com]uybmmfpkj[/link]","_id":"VhhWOfmynpHIueRq"}

I found the ahrouts website based on the book and then I pre-ordered it and got it only the day after it was officially released on July 1st, 2009. WARNING: Full on raving and 5 star shenanigans ahead I read this book in 2 days. Not an easy feat as I look after two girls, 9 and 2, AND a 44 year old kid posing as my husband.Once I read the first few sentences I could not put it down. Now, granted, my husband and I have been talking about a trip like this for as long as we have been together, and we place world travel very high on our priority list, so that could be why I just inhaled the thing. But don't take my word for it either! Just check out Amazon.com! In just 6 weeks this non-fiction delight has garnered ONLY 5 star ratings, and rave reviews. And I can totally understand why.John Higham is a rocket scientist. Not as in,  Oh gee, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.  No, he really IS one. He and his wife took 10 years to plan the  world the round  trip (as one of his children exclaimed in their toddler years), and he not only gives great detail of their travels but it is entertaining as heck and hilarious at times! When was the last time you laughed out loud while reading a travel memoir other than a Bill Bryson? Not only is it wildly entertaining, it is also educational without being text-booky, and honestly? You just feel like you are along for the ride, the tandem bike ride, as that is how this family largely travelled. Surviving on ham sandwiches and hitting the off-off beat track and getting sidetracked by some crazy stuff, you will feel like you know each and everyone of these people intimately. Not only that, if you have any interest at all in travelling the world? This will definitely inspire you to google earth yourself an itinerary.The other neat thing the author did, he created a layer within Google Earth and there are many photos and extra little anecdotes to follow along as you read.

Nor am I the type to read passages out loud to family members and friends but as I read this book I found myslef doing both.From the first few pages I found myslef drawn in and welcomed as a part of the authors family.  It was so easy to become swept away right along with them in their travels.  The author does a fantastic job of illustrating with vivid detail the beautiful countryside and then the not so lavish areas as well.  There were so many parts where I giggled out loud.  As I got caught up in the story going on in my mind I was then able to click on the computer and see first hand the beauty of the landscape and/or the entertaining antidotes of the families travels. The Google earth layer was entertaining.  I found myslef putting sticky notes in the book at the parts I wanted to view online because I just had to keep reading to find out what the next adventure or family joke would be.I loved that the children helped create this book with their journal entries.  It certainly is a different perspective to an already witty, insightful and thought provoking book.I have to admit when I read about some of the locations that this family visited my jaw dropped and I thought to my self `YOU TOOK YOUR KIDS WHERE???'But as I read my preconceived notions were changed and I took on a different perspective (and admittedly that is NOT an easy thing for me to do).  And I am so glad that I got the chance to modify my thoughts as did this family.  There were many heartendering experiences that will leave an impression on me even though I didn't experience it first hand.  It was so easy to see through the eyes of this family, children included.I'm sure that I will never have the opportunity to travel the world but after reading the book I wanted to offer my appreciation to the Higham's for allowing me to share their travels Round-the-World. http://tebolv.com [url=http://oexuzae.com]oexuzae[/url] [link=http://zeigkahscwe.com]zeigkahscwe[/link]","_id":"OVQTWwlITMxR6eYL"}

However, this book reached out and grabbed me and wouldn't let go until I'd turned the last page. As I traveled vicariously around the world with the Highams (Dad John; Mom September, Katrina age 11 and Jordan age 8), I'd hear the train whistles, see the sunsets, get drenched in the rain, and even hobble around with one broken leg and a crutch. But what really impressed me was the Highams themselves: their resourcefulness, their obvious respect and love for each other, their good-natured kidding, their intelligence, their care and friendliness as they met people very different from themselves, and especially their good humor as they dealt with daunting problems. Their hallmark was flexibility: Katrina breaking her leg but insisting on continuing their trip; shipping their bikes back home and continuing their journey on public transportation (bus, train, plane, boat, guided tours with questionable safety precautions); and being the only hikers hiking Machu Picchu without porters (dad had forgotten to check the box).

Very easy  And another issue. If you in the Summary report filter the entries by on or more users, and then click on an entry then the selection of users is not transfered to the view in the Detailed report.

Easy to pick up and hard to put down, I have learned a good deal about different peoples and countries in the world, and burst out in frequent laughter. My 8-year old daughter enjoyed listening to excerpts, and was then motivated to find locations on maps or look online for more information about a particular topic. It has inspired me to think of destinations outside of my comfort zone for family travel, as well as contemplate ways to just plain spend more time with my own family.

Bach for Rating: I found this little gem in my liarbry.  I agree with other reviewers that this is an easy read; after I got past the first page, I just inhaled it.  As a father of two children who aren't too different in age from the Higham children, it was easy for me to feel like I was traveling in their group.  Why did I enjoy it so much?  Because: 1.  It is laugh-out-loud funny, but it isn't a funny book, if that makes any sense.2.  It made me lie awake at night thinking about what I want to teach my own children about the world, and how best to accomplish that. What I really liked about this book is that it wasn't about somebody's mid-life crisis that they inflicted on their kids.  The idea of traveling as a family was in the works for over a decade, before the author and his wife even had kids.  Why?  To paraphrase the author, he had learned how travel can shape one's thinking and wanted to give that experience to his children.  In that sense, it isn't about some rich family's adventure, but about an average family's desire to discover the world.As you might imagine, a lot (good and bad) can happen over the course of traveling for a year.  There is too much to list, and I don't want to spoil any of it if you haven't read the book yet. BUT I admire their tenacity to keep going; some of the misadventures would have sent lesser people (like me) home.  As their year unfolds you see the family not only grow closer together but also see them grow as a family.  For example, the larger lessons one might learn at Auschwitz are apparently lost on the two young children because of large crowds and unbearable heat.  But by the time those same two children arrive at the Killing Fields outside of Phnom Penh, the heat is no longer a factor and it is clear that the ugliness of war makes a lasting impression, even on the eight-year-old, who sums up their time in Cambodia by saying,  Some things you remember even though you wish you didn't have to.  The end result is a great story.  Perhaps not in the Harry Potter sense of the word  great,  but it has its own greatness that is palpable because it is a story of real events.  I think anyone who wants to gain an appreciation for other cultures should read this book. So, if I picked up a copy in my liarbry, why am I writing a review on Amazon?  Because like another reviewer, I decided that I was making this my gift of choice this Holiday season.  And the first person I'm giving it to is myself. http://esxgmlius.com [url=http://esjauclgvd.com]esjauclgvd[/url] [link=http://mxhvhntesc.com]mxhvhntesc[/link]","_id":"WIwxn4ZlDuU51Tq9"}

I found the atouhrs website based on the book and then I pre-ordered it and got it only the day after it was officially released on July 1st, 2009. WARNING: Full on raving and 5 star shenanigans ahead I read this book in 2 days. Not an easy feat as I look after two girls, 9 and 2, AND a 44 year old kid posing as my husband.Once I read the first few sentences I could not put it down. Now, granted, my husband and I have been talking about a trip like this for as long as we have been together, and we place world travel very high on our priority list, so that could be why I just inhaled the thing. But don't take my word for it either! Just check out Amazon.com! In just 6 weeks this non-fiction delight has garnered ONLY 5 star ratings, and rave reviews. And I can totally understand why.John Higham is a rocket scientist. Not as in,  Oh gee, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.  No, he really IS one. He and his wife took 10 years to plan the  world the round  trip (as one of his children exclaimed in their toddler years), and he not only gives great detail of their travels but it is entertaining as heck and hilarious at times! When was the last time you laughed out loud while reading a travel memoir other than a Bill Bryson? Not only is it wildly entertaining, it is also educational without being text-booky, and honestly? You just feel like you are along for the ride, the tandem bike ride, as that is how this family largely travelled. Surviving on ham sandwiches and hitting the off-off beat track and getting sidetracked by some crazy stuff, you will feel like you know each and everyone of these people intimately. Not only that, if you have any interest at all in travelling the world? This will definitely inspire you to google earth yourself an itinerary.The other neat thing the author did, he created a layer within Google Earth and there are many photos and extra little anecdotes to follow along as you read. Every time you see the little Google Earth symbol in the text you can visit the website and see the added bonus! GENIUS! All in all a FANTASTIC read for anyone, but especially those of us wanting to travel with our kids.To read more reviews please visit [....] http://jpnsppqdo.com [url=http://muilbnu.com]muilbnu[/url] [link=http://pgdxjxpjh.com]pgdxjxpjh[/link]","_id":"A2mqNKwXJukOdp2h"}

It was so easy to become swept away right along with them in their travels.  The author does a fantastic job of illustrating with vivid detail the beautiful countryside and then the not so lavish areas as well.  There were so many parts where I giggled out loud.  As I got caught up in the story going on in my mind I was then able to click on the computer and see first hand the beauty of the landscape and/or the entertaining antidotes of the families travels. The Google earth layer was entertaining.  I found myeslf putting sticky notes in the book at the parts I wanted to view online because I just had to keep reading to find out what the next adventure or family joke would be.I loved that the children helped create this book with their journal entries.  It certainly is a different perspective to an already witty, insightful and thought provoking book.I have to admit when I read about some of the locations that this family visited my jaw dropped and I thought to my self `YOU TOOK YOUR KIDS WHERE???'But as I read my preconceived notions were changed and I took on a different perspective (and admittedly that is NOT an easy thing for me to do).  And I am so glad that I got the chance to modify my thoughts as did this family.  There were many heartendering experiences that will leave an impression on me even though I didn't experience it first hand.  It was so easy to see through the eyes of this family, children included.I'm sure that I will never have the opportunity to travel the world but after reading the book I wanted to offer my appreciation to the Higham's for allowing me to share their travels Round-the-World. http://swxextvvag.com [url=http://vunsgo.com]vunsgo[/url] [link=http://yvcguzy.com]yvcguzy[/link]","_id":"Cs3giRGfHWal4KDN"}

And the concept of having magnitude-based divisions seems intuitively good, although it does make the world less interesting (which as I get older and learn more is to me not a trivial point).But it seems to me that (a) 12 is a better unified base than 10 (or 8), since it is evenly divisible by 2, 3, and 4 (b) one of the key factors in choosing 10 as the metric base was that it was NOT the 12 of the English syestm.  This too is not a trival point, as anyone who has ever dealt with standards committtes that include French engineers can attest.So - my preferred outcome of the metric committee would have been a base 12 syestm with order-of-magnitude subunits.Now, that is just my opinion, and I may well be wrong.

I'm not much of a traveler; I don't enjoy cnmpiag; I rarely ride my bike (have never ridden a tandem); and am indifferent to ham and cheese sandwiches. However, this book reached out and grabbed me and wouldn't let go until I'd turned the last page. As I traveled vicariously around the world with the Highams (Dad John; Mom September, Katrina age 11 and Jordan age 8), I'd hear the train whistles, see the sunsets, get drenched in the rain, and even hobble around with one broken leg and a crutch. But what really impressed me was the Highams themselves: their resourcefulness, their obvious respect and love for each other, their good-natured kidding, their intelligence, their care and friendliness as they met people very different from themselves, and especially their good humor as they dealt with daunting problems. Their hallmark was flexibility: Katrina breaking her leg but insisting on continuing their trip; shipping their bikes back home and continuing their journey on public transportation (bus, train, plane, boat, guided tours with questionable safety precautions); and being the only hikers hiking Machu Picchu without porters (dad had forgotten to check the box). The book ended with each participant writing a brief epilogue, revealing how their travels had changed their lives, changed their attitudes toward each other, and changed their attitudes toward those with vastly different backgrounds and experiences. A thoroughly engrossing read. http://nluvns.com [url=http://vztbxtelreb.com]vztbxtelreb[/url] [link=http://tmhaos.com]tmhaos[/link]","_id":"iVyY29DJmF8IwEVZ"}

If you in the Summary report filter the entries by on or more users, and then click on an entry then the selection of users is not transfered to the view in the Detailed report.

My niece had several Fujikawa books that were rectenly handed down to my daughter. The hand-me-down copy of Babies (printed in 1980) was getting torn up so I ordered a new one to replace it. The new copy is missing 6 pages. My daughter is 19 months old and flips back and forth saying  grow, grow  looking for pages that are not there. Everything else is the same. This is still a beautiful book but I'm very dissapointed that this new version is missing pages and so is my daughter.Should have read the reviews before buying this reprint (printed in 2006). http://kpigtolfi.com [url=http://esvnhhsxv.com]esvnhhsxv[/url] [link=http://axgerpm.com]axgerpm[/link]","_id":"ub269xy2l7aSr0il"}

I prefer to see the pentercages also.  I understand the diffiuclty of fitting them on the pie chart.
